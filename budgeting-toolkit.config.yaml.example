# Budget Configuration
expectedMonthlyPaycheck: 5000.00
validDestinationAccounts:
    - '1' # Checking Account ID
    - '2' # Savings Account ID

validExpenseAccounts:
    - '3' # Credit Card Account ID
    - '4' # Debit Card Account ID

excludedAdditionalIncomePatterns:
    - 'PAYROLL'
    - 'ATM FEE'
    - 'TRANSFER'

# These are transfers that would be counted towards unbudgeted expenses
validTransfers:
    - source: '5' # Remote Investment Account ID
      destination: '1' # Checking Account ID

excludeDisposableIncome: false

# Custom tag names (optional - override if you use different tags in Firefly III)
# tags:
#     disposableIncome: 'Fun Money'
#     bills: 'Bills'

# Globally excluded transactions (removes transactions from all reports)
# At least one field (description or amount) is required per entry
excludedTransactions:
    # Example 1: Exclude by description only (any amount)
    - description: 'STOCK INVESTMENT'
      reason: 'Investment purchase - not a regular expense'

    # Example 2: Exclude by description and amount (exact match)
    - description: 'Monthly Rent'
      amount: '1200.00'
      reason: 'Rent payment - already tracked elsewhere'

    # Example 3: Exclude by amount only (any description)
    - amount: '999.99'
      reason: 'Specific amount to filter out'

    # Example 4: Transfer to savings (description only)
    - description: 'TRANSFER TO SAVINGS'
      reason: 'Internal transfer, not an expense'

# Firefly specific configurations
firefly:
    noNameExpenseAccountId: '5' # ID of the (no name) expense account that firefly creates automatically on installation

# LLM Configuration (Advanced)
llm:
    # Basic LLM Settings
    maxTokens: 1000 # Maximum tokens per response
    batchSize: 10 # Transactions processed per batch
    maxConcurrent: 3 # Maximum concurrent API requests
    temperature: 0.2 # Response randomness (0-1, lower = more deterministic)
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5' # Default model (user-friendly name)
    retryDelayMs: 1500 # Initial retry delay (default)
    maxRetryDelayMs: 32000 # Maximum retry delay in milliseconds

    # Rate Limiting Configuration
    rateLimit:
        maxTokensPerMinute: 50000 # Token budget per minute (default)
        refillInterval: 60000 # Token refill interval in milliseconds

    # Circuit Breaker Configuration
    circuitBreaker:
        failureThreshold: 5 # Number of failures before opening circuit
        resetTimeout: 60000 # Time to wait before attempting reset (ms)
        halfOpenTimeout: 30000 # Time to stay in half-open state (ms)

# Performance Notes:
# - Batch processing reduces API calls by 80-90%
# - Lower maxConcurrent values prevent rate limiting
# - Higher batchSize improves efficiency but uses more tokens
# - Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
# - Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
